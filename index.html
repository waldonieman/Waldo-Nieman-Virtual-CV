      <div class="section-content">
        <p>
            I am currently a final-year BSc Information Technology (IT) student at North-West University (NWU). 
            As a dynamic student, I thrive in ever-changing environments. My adaptability allows me to take on diverse challenges with enthusiasm and creativity. 
            Discipline is at the core of my work ethic. I adhere to schedules, meet project deadlines, and maintain a consistent focus and routine. Punctuality is a sign of respect for me. 
            I value others’ time and consistently arrive on time for meetings, code reviews, and project milestones. I am a team player with an eye for detail. 
            I enjoy working with other people and value others’ ideas. Sometimes I prefer to work alone on some tasks since everyone doesn’t have the same standards. 
            Lastly, I hold myself to high moral standards. Integrity, honesty, and empathy guide my actions.
